# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've learned the basics of variables and data types on Python in a great tutorial in Freecodecamp Youtube Channel 

**Thoughts:** I'm not at the speed I'd like to be, but I'm going one day at a time

### Day 2: January 05, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've learned more about map and how I can create manually a function that simulates the map function

**Thoughts:** Programming is hard and rewarding. Learning by yourself how to resolve a problemw without seeing other people's code is awesome.

### Day 3: January 06, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: I'm starting to understand more about functions and how map works! I've just coded a piece of work that I used to find complext before. Awesome! 

**Thoughts:** I think I'm improving every day. I can feel it!

### Day 4: January 07, 2020 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I solved a lot of challenges quite quickly and I'm proud of me. Now I'm working in a freecodecamp's challenge to use reduce. Reduce is a function that appeared sometimes and I didn't have any idea of how to use it. Now here I am working with it! Awesome.

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying working in this journal. Even though I'm not sharing in the world in Twitter, this is helping me a lot already.

### Day 5: January 08, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I used reduce and finally got how it works! Of course I need to practice more, but I solved a challenge with it. Awesome!

**Thoughts:** I've used filter, map and reduce to solve a challenge and I'm feeling great!

### Day 6: January 09, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working with reduce, filter and map. They're quite a challenge, don't they? It's different than using for. I was so used to for, but I know that's not always the right solution.

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how I'm getting somethings quite quickly these past days. I like it!

### Day 7: January 10, 2020 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I didn't get to code so much because I woke up at 5:30AM and spent some time trying to renew ESET's license. But that's ok! So, today I worked with sort and understood a little more of how this awesome tool works.

**Thoughts:** Every day I'm feeling that I'm getting things faster! That's super cool!

### Day 8: January 11, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I'm working in a challenge with split and I suppose I can solve it using Regex, but Regex is tricky and I'm still cracking it.  

**Thoughts:** Ok, I've learned filter, map and reduce! Regex is hard, but I can learn. That's how I feel!

### Day 9: January 12, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've learned a bit more about Regexp and split! I finally got how I can use /\W/ in the split method. I confess that was hard to understand (kkk)

**Thoughts:** I didn't like to check the answer on freecodecamp, but I was stuck and I didn't find the answer on Google. But it's great that I could get how to solve it!

### Day 10: January 13, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've learned about every, some and how to curry a function. I'm almost finishing the Javascript course. Amazing! 

**Thoughts:** There's so much to learn. This excites me and at the same time, frightens me. Confusing, right?

### Day 11: January 14, 2020 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I'm using filter, regexp, map, reduce, concat! All together to solve intermediate algorithms! That's truly awesome!!

**Thoughts:** I'm in constantly fear of getting stuck. I get by it by being very mechanical. Get up and do. Get up and do.

### Day 12: January 15, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I'm struggling at this challenge to differentiate two arrays, but this struggle is awesome!

**Thoughts:** I was looking for a group to pair project/or just to talk about code and I think I've found one!

### Day 13: January 16, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I'm still trying to solve the challenge to diff two arrays!!

**Thoughts:** Oh, I need to create more time for this! Or maybe read more about it whenever I'm away from my PC
