# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've learned the basics of variables and data types on Python in a great tutorial in Freecodecamp Youtube Channel 

**Thoughts:** I'm not at the speed I'd like to be, but I'm going one day at a time

### Day 2: January 05, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've learned more about map and how I can create manually a function that simulates the map function

**Thoughts:** Programming is hard and rewarding. Learning by yourself how to resolve a problemw without seeing other people's code is awesome.
